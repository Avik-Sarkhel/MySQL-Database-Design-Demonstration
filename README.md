# MySQL-Database-Design-Demonstration
## Project Overview

This repository contains the SQL scripts for setting up and querying an `online_retail` database. This project serves as a demonstration of relational database design, data manipulation, and analytical querying using MySQL.

## Database Schema

The database models a simplified online retail system and includes the following key tables:

* **`categories`**: Product classifications.
* **`products`**: Detailed product information.
* **`customers`**: Customer demographics and signup details.
* **`orders`**: Records of customer purchases.
* **`order_items`**: Junction table detailing products within each order.
* **`payments`**: Payment records associated with orders.
* **`shipping`**: Shipping and delivery information for orders.

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

An Entity Relationship Diagram visually representing the database schema and relationships between tables is included in the project for clear structural understanding.

## SQL Query Demonstrations

A series of SQL queries are provided to showcase various data retrieval and analysis capabilities:

1.  **Order Details by Customer:** Lists customer and their order information.
2.  **Out of Stock Products:** Identifies products with zero stock.
3.  **Total Sales per Product:** Calculates total revenue generated by each product.
4.  **Top-Spending Customer:** Determines the customer with the highest total spending.
5.  **Shipping Details:** Shows orders with their shipping status and delivery address.
6.  **Orders per Product:** Counts how many orders each product has been part of.
7.  **Most Popular Category:** Identifies the category with the most items sold.

## Resources Used

* **MySQL Workbench**: For database management and querying.
* **Microsoft PowerPoint**: For presentation creation.
* **DrawSQL**: For Entity Relationship Diagram generation.
* **Slidesgo**: For presentation template.
* **Flaticon**: For icons and stickers.
* **ChatGPT**: For enhancing content.

## Future Enhancements

* **Data Extraction for Analysis:** Exporting datasets into formats like Excel for in-depth analysis.
* **Data Visualization:** Integrating with business intelligence tools such as Power BI to create interactive dashboards and derive deeper insights.
